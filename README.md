# Data Science Projects Repository
Welcome to my Data Science Projects repository! This space is dedicated to showcasing my work across various data science domains, including machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and more. Each project reflects my approach to tackling real-world problems, utilizing tools and techniques in data science and AI.
The first 4 projects:
  1. Area and population
  2. Birth Rate Analysis
  3. Project on time series
  4. US president heights


These are the base projects, that helped me take off as a data scientist! 
I shall update more projects soon!!
